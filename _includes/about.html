            <p style="text-align:justify;">Object tracking is an important research topic in computer vision and pattern recognition. Despite its success in research and practice, tracking in
grayscale or color videos has its intrinsic limitations
in depicting physical properties of targets,
especially reflectance of materials. It makes
trackers vulnerable in complex scenarios with
cluttered background and significant object shape
changes. This problem can be effectively
addressed by object tracking in hyperspectral
videos which provide joint spectral, spatial, and
temporal information, enabling the tracking system
to perceive the materials besides the shape,
texture, and semantic relationship of objects.</p>





        <p style="text-align:justify;">In 2024, we organize The Fourth Hyperspectral Object Tracking Challenge  with the <a href="https://www.ieee-whispers.com/">14th Workshop on Hyperspectral Image and Signal Processing: Evolution in Remote Sensing (WHISPERS)</a>. The goal of this contest is to boost the research on hyperspectral object tracking. A special session will be organized for all accepted
papers which will also be included in the
WHISPERS proceedings to be published in the
IEEE Xplore.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A frame-by-frame labelled dataset with 182 training
videos and 89 validation videos is provided.
Moreover, we also provide 75 unlabeled
hyperspectral videos as a testing set for ranking
purpose. Each video contains hyperspectral data
and false-color data generated from the
hyperspectral data. We also provide the codes and
results of a number of tracking methods as
baselines. Please refer to the <a href="/result">results</a> page.</p>



        <p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:blue;font-weight: 500;">All participants are required to submit a report to the WHISPERS paper review system under "the challengeï¼šhyperspectral object tracking challenge" track. All participants shall also submit the tracking results on the
unlabeled testing set to the contest organizer. Please email the tracking results to  hsotracking@gmail.com and also  cc to   fcxiong@njust.edu.cn. </span> A special session will be organised for all accepted papers which will also be included in the WHISPERS proceedings. </p>

<!-- <p style="text-align:justify;  font-weight: bold;"> We made some updates to the training and validation set. Please refer to the <a href="/contest">contest</a> page. (2023, 07.12)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;  font-weight: bold;"> We released the tracking results of some color trackers on the false-color sequences. Please refer to the <a href="/result">result</a> page. (2023, 07.12)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-weight: bold;"> We uploaded the dataset to Google Drive. Please refer to the <a href="/result">contest</a> page. (2023, 07.12)</p>


<p style="text-align:justify; color: red; font-weight: bold;">  We extend the  deadline for the contest as follows:
<ul style="text-align: left;">
    <li>Test Data Available: August 25th</li>
    <li>Submission Deadline (including the paper and tracking results): August 30th. Please note that the time for paper submission can be flexible upon special request.</li>
    <li>Announcement of Winners: September 5th</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify; color: red; font-weight: bold;"> Please also send me an email (fcxiong@njust.edu.cn) confirming your participation in the contest. This will allow us to make early arrangements for the review process and ensure smooth proceedings. (2023, 08.10)
