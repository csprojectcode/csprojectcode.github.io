            <p style="text-align:justify;">Object tracking is an active research topic in computer vision and pattern recognition. We have witnessed significant progress on this topic over the past several years, with approaches moving from hand-crafted features to deep learning families. Nevertheless, tracking in grayscale or color videos has its intrinsic limitations in depicting  physical properties of targets, especially reflectance of materials. It makes trackers vulnerable in complex scenarios with cluttered background and significant object shape changes. This problem can be effectively addressed by object tracking in hyperspectral videos which provide joint spectral, spatial, and temporal information, enabling  computer vision system to perceive the materials of the objects besides the shape, texture, and semantic relationship of objects.</p>

        <p style="text-align:justify;">The goal of this contest is to boost the research on hyperspectral object tracking. A frame-by-frame labelled dataset with 40 training videos and 35 testing videos is provided. Moreover, we also provide newly collected 40 unlabeled hyperspectral videos for ranking purpose.  The dataset will be released on 25 June, 2022. Each video contains hyperspectral data, RGB data, and false-color data generated from the hyperspectral data. We also provide the codes and results of a number of tracking methods as baseline results.</p>



        <p style="text-align:justify;">This contest is the second hyperspectral object tracking challenge  and organized in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.ieee-whispers.com/">12th Workshop on Hyperspectral Image and Signal Processing: Evolution in Remote Sensing (WHISPERS)</a>. <font color="red">All participants are required to submit a report with their results to the WHISPERS paper review system. Besides the paper, all the participants are required to submit the tracking results of unlabeled videos for ranking purpose.  A special session, i.e, Computer Vision Session</font> will be organised for accepted papers which will also be included in the WHISPERS proceedings. <font color="red">Please submit your manuscript to Computer Vision Session.</font>  </p>
